<strong>Arepa&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<em>Arepa </em>&nbsp;is a type of food made of ground maize dough stuffed with a filling, eaten in northern parts of South America since pre-Columbian times, and notable primarily in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela, but also present in Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Panama.</p>

<p>Initially, arepa flour was made by grinding maize at home. In the 1950s, precooked arepa flour was invented by Luis Caballero Mej&iacute;as, a Venezuelan engineer, and became an instant success.</p>

<p>Arepa is commonly eaten in those countries and can be served with accompaniments such as cheese, cuajada (fresh cheese), various types of meat, avocado, or diablito (deviled ham spread). It can also be split to make sandwiches. Sizes, maize types, and added ingredients vary based on preparation. It is similar to the Mexican gordita, the Salvadoran pupusa, the Ecuadorian tortilla de ma&iacute;z,[4] and the Panamanian tortilla or changa.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&lt;<strong>Origins</strong><br />
&lt;p&gt;The arepa is a pre-Columbian dish from the area that is now Colombia, Panama and Venezuela. Instruments used to make flour for the arepas, and the clay slabs on which they were cooked, were often found at archaeological sites in the area.[citation needed] Although it has not been specified in which country an arepa was cooked for the first time, it has been possible to define the oldest dates of the presence of maize in Colombia and Venezuela. For example, in Colombia, the first record of the existence of corn dates from about 3,000 years ago, while in Venezuela, the estimate is about 2,800 years ago.</p>
